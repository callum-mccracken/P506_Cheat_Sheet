\textbf{Symmetries and the Quark Model}

\textbf{Symmetries}

Conservation of energy, momentum, charge, spin, baryon number, lepton number, colour charge, charge conjugation

Lepton flavour conserved at $\gamma, Z$ but not $W$ vertices.

Symmetries $\iff$ conserved quantities

- transform under symm, Taylor expand

- write as $\psi' = (1 + i\epsilon \hat{A})\psi$,$\implies$ $\hat{A}$ conserved

- e.g., translation $\leftrightarrow$ momentum

- Not applicable $\neq$ not conserved!

Strong interaction: tried to introduce isospin, with $u = (1,0), d=(0,1)$, corresponds to invariance under SU(2), $T_+ u = 0, T_+ d = u$.
